How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It pointed out the number of the modified line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would help to correct bad modifications and find the correct version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
It just depends on how awesome I am as a programmer (both pro and con).

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because they are intended for applications which require many files to work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Just... typing them in the console, I guess...
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because it allows me to unbreak stuff and see what broke it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
World domination, obviously.
