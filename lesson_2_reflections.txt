What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Some basic configuration and folders are added. It is needed because otherwise I could not access Git functionalities.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is different as it is a logic organization of files to be committed. It allows the user to make modifications before doing a commit.
